Here I implemented a siple subscription mock application, where a user can hold a database of many
entertainment subscriptions. They can also keep track of their upcoming payments, and remove
subscriptions that they no longer have.
Each subscription has a start date where if a user enters subscriptions initially, they will 
add the start date as well. If the user adds any more subscripions moving forward, 
The program will compute the start date. 
An option to cancel a subscription is available, which creates an end date.
